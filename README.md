# nextjs-typescript-boilerplate

## :rocket: Easly get started Next.js with TypeScript!

Comes with basic ESLint & Prettier configuration and VSCode settings.

This boilerplate uses [@zeit/next-typescript](https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-typescript) .

@zeit/next-typescript uses babel to compile
(this means this plugin doesn't provide typechecking itself).
Typechecking depends on VSCode in this boilerplate.

Enjoy!
